## Prerequisites:

* Python3
* PyTorch == 1.5.0 (with suitable CUDA and CuDNN version)
* Numpy
* argparse
* PIL
* tqdm

## Contribution:

The contributions of this paper are four-fold:  
1. We propose a novel debiased prototype network to improve the transferability of image representations for adversarial domain adaptation. Our approach demonstrates that the prototype network extracts invariant features more efficiently. 
2. We propose a debiased method which is utilized to reduce the intra- and inter- class bias for prototype network. 
3. We have conducted extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can lead to a relatively large improvement in classification accuracy.
